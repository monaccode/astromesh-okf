## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- `Bundle`: read-only access to an OKF v0.2 bundle (`index`, `read`, `find`), ported from
  the Astromesh core 0.68.0 reader. Tolerant parsing per OKF §11, trust (`verified`),
  freshness (`stale_after`), `status` and warnings; links resolved to concept ids; paths
  confined to the bundle root with symlinks resolved first.
- `OKFTools`: `kb_index`, `kb_read` and `kb_find` as string-returning, never-raising tools
  with argument coercion and a `prefix` for several bundles in one agent.
- Framework adapters, each an optional extra: LangChain/LangGraph (`langchain`), CrewAI
  (`crewai`), Google ADK (`adk`), OpenAI Agents SDK (`openai-agents`), PydanticAI
  (`pydantic-ai`, Python 3.11+), LlamaIndex (`llamaindex`), smolagents (`smolagents`) and
  Microsoft Agent Framework (`agent-framework`).
- MCP server (`mcp` extra) and the `astromesh-okf` CLI: `mcp`, `index`, `read`, `find`.
- Runnable examples for every framework, MCP configs for Claude Desktop and Cursor, and a
  sample `support` bundle.
- CI: core tests on Python 3.10–3.13, one job per extra, and a check that reads Google's
  four sample bundles with zero concepts skipped.

### Security

- Frontmatter with YAML anchors or aliases (including merge keys `<<: *name`) is rejected as an
  invalid concept, so a hostile bundle cannot expand into gigabytes or a self-referencing
  structure. Error messages never include absolute filesystem paths.
